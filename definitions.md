## 'Everything is a file' - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file)

`directory` - A folder

`file` - A form of storing information. Files live in directories.

`program` - A set of instructions. A program can be stored on a file.

E.g. a cassette tape is like a file and the casette player is the program. Without the player, you still have the information but you need the 'program' to play it.

[Wikipedia Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program)

`function` - A process or action. Functions can exist in tree models, with multiple functions informing the main function. 

A function always needs to be defined before it can be called. 

When we define functions with input/inputs like so:

``` python
def foo(x):
    return x + 1
```
we name the input so we can use the inputs within the function. 

When we call functions like so:

``` python
x = 10
y = foo(x)
```
we pass them values (e.g. names of variables, or hard-coded constants like strings and numbers)
In this case, we are passing the variable `x` (which has been assigned the number '10') to the function `foo`.
