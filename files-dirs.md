## Terminology

`directory` - A folder

`file` - A form of storing information. Files live in directories.

`program` - A set of instructions. A program can be stored on a file.

E.g. a cassette tape is like a file and the casette player is the program. Without the player, you still have the information but you need the 'program' to play it.
