Gnu Privacy Guard

>GnuPG is a hybrid-encryption software program because it uses a combination of conventional symmetric-key cryptography for speed, and public-key cryptography for ease of secure key exchange, typically by using the recipient's public key to encrypt a session key which is only used once. This mode of operation is part of the OpenPGP standard and has been part of PGP from its first version. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard)

GPG is for keeping passwords secure
